# chat-app
A chat with rooms where users can send and receive messages in real time.

## Implementation of technologies:

* WebSockets: For instant message and notification delivery.

* ~~SSE: For displaying notifications about new users or events (e.g. "User joined").~~

* ~~Long Polling: As a fallback option for devices or browsers without WebSocket support.~~

* ~~Short Polling: For periodic checking of the number of unread messages.~~

## Additional: 

* Implemented authorization, ~~message history~~ and support for multiple rooms.
